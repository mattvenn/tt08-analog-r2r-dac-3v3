## How it works

A simple 8 bit R2R DAC. Driven externally or by an OpenLane generated sawtooth waveform generator.

3.3v output is achieved with level shifting drivers.

## How to test

### Drive externally

Set the `external data` input high to provide the DAC with external data.
Then drive the 8 inputs and observe the analog output.

### Drive with internal sawtooth wave generator

Set the `external data` input low to enable the sawtooth generator.
A sawtooth wave should be seen on the analog output.

To change the frequency, set the inputs and then raise the 'load divider' input.

## External hardware

A multimeter to measure the output voltage on analog pin 0.
